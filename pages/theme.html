                <h4>The Ensuing Tomorrow</h4>
                <p>What is happening today, that we are so doubtful about the Earth's survival? What kinds of human influences / natural phenomena are causing such dynamic changes in the earth's way of functioning? What is being done today that will ruin our tomorrow? What can be done today to make tomorrow better? Is it sustainable and ethical to exploit all the scarce resources and leave none for the future?  We will find the answers to all these questions from a humanitarian, an artist and a scientist's point of view. 
                This theme takes care of the future, and how can today's actions affect the well-being of tomorrow. Ecocentric and Technocentric approaches shall be applied here in order to draw out good solutions for the problems that will be identified during the course of the theme group discussions. 
                </p>
                <h5>Science</h5>
                <p>Science has been
                  used to solve so
                  many problems, be
                  it as small as a cold
                  or a very
                  complicated one
                  like producing
                  machinery.
                  However, if science
                  can be used to solve
                  various problems,
                  the fact that science
                  has also created
                  various problems
                  like causing
                  eutrophication in a
                  lake or causing a
                  large nuclear
                  disaster and is also
                  vulnerable to create
                  problems in the
                  future like the sixth
                  mass extinction, is
                  ignored. What can
                  be done TODAY,
                  that we can improve
                  THE ENSUING
                  TOMORROW?
                </p>
                <h5>Arts</h5>
                <p>
                  A good way to
                  visualise the future is
                  to express it
                  explicitly. Art as a
                  medium could
                  exquisitely express
                  the same. Art is not
                  only about creating
                  something that is
                  appealing, but also
                  about expressing
                  emotions and
                  thoughts implicitly.
                  Art is about making
                  others believe in your
                  expressions. We do
                  not know what the
                  future holds or what
                  it will seem like. Now
                  it depends on us how
                  we want to see our
                  tomorrow?
                  How one will express
                  their version of
                  THE ENSUING
                  TOMORROW by a
                  few strokes of a
                  brush.
                </p>
                <h5>Humanities</h5>
                <p>Humanities is a very
                  broad topic that has
                  evolved
                  substantially over
                  the past few decades
                  and if this trend
                  continues into
                  tomorrow, it will
                  mend tomorrow.
                  The fact that, for
                  instance, LGBT is
                  now a widely
                  accepted
                  phenomenon could
                  and may not have
                  been approved by
                  the older
                  generation, but as
                  people of tomorrow,
                  we respect
                  individuality. But
                  what if this trend
                  continues only to
                  allow incest,
                  because the logic
                  remains the same, is
                  and will that be an
                  acceptable
                  reasoning?
                  </p>
                <h4>Change is Constant</h4>
                <p>Change is constant and history has been testament to that. Change however is a difference from our current state as a human race. But it is us who decide if the change is positive or negative. From the time of Pangea to today, from the time when there was no human race to Evolution now, from the time when man had the most simple life to today our highly technologically influenced life, the only thing that is constant is continuous change.
                So arts, sciences and humanities have had their share of  evolution and we are the today that can bring about change. Which way to take our race and life is in our hand. So what is the role of science to bring constant change to humanity to create art? 
                </p>
                <h5>Science</h5>
                <p>
                  From medicine, to
                  inventions that make
                  daily living just a little
                  bit easier, scientific
                  changes are what have
                  help our world
                  progress into what it
                  has become today.
                  Changes in the
                  scientific world stem
                  from people constantly
                  trying to question the
                  norm, and going
                  completely in the other
                  direction. “It is the
                  crazy ones, the round
                  pegs in square holes
                  that push the human
                  race forward” - Steve
                  Jobs. So, how should
                  the view of people
                  going against the norm,
                  CHANGE in order to
                  provoke progression in
                  the scientific world?
                </p>
                <h5>Arts</h5>
                <p>
                  Art has always
                  been a reflection of
                  society, and society
                  of art. Change is a
                  mere embodiment
                  of life, and life is
                  simply art.
                  Like the setting
                  sun at dusk and the
                  rising sun at dawn,
                  change is the only
                  constant that we
                  all have.
                  As our skills
                  develop, we slowly
                  have left the
                  imprints of our
                  soul on the sand of
                  the world through
                  art...
                  How does art
                  CHANGE and
                  bring about
                  CHANGE in the
                  CONSTANT, our
                  world?
                </p>
                <h5>Humanities</h5>
                <p>
                  There is, and
                  always has been a
                  constant change
                  in societal
                  structure from the
                  dawn of human
                  civilisation. In the
                  20th and 21st
                  centuries,
                  governments,
                  regimes,
                  legislations, and
                  leaders have all
                  been subject to
                  continuous
                  development and
                  deconstruction.
                  What is our role
                  in this atmosphere
                  where CHANGE
                  IS CONSTANT,
                  and how do we
                  adapt in order to
                  bring about the
                  best in humanity
                </p>
                <h4>In Retrospect</h4>
                <p>We learn from our mistakes and our ultimate goal is to move forward at a pace unmatchable by any other specie. But to move forward, we must take a look back, look and see what dwells in our past and reflect. Our society remains on the edge and the fate of our tomorrow solely lies in our hand, hence, it is only when we assess our past can we ride into horizons of a better future. 
                Processing what we have done and taking inspiration is what keeps fueling the fire, so look back, reflect and learn to move forward together. Reflect on not only yours, but also on the  entire mankind’s decisions to ensure no further colossal damage to the society.
                </p>
                <h5>Science</h5>
                <p>
                  Science has
                  almost always
                  been our answer
                  to every problem
                  we face but has
                  this solution
                  caused the
                  problems we face
                  today? Looking
                  back, without
                  science we
                  wouldn’t have
                  such developed
                  technology nor
                  would we have
                  been able to save
                  so many lives due
                  to medical
                  advancement but
                  science can also
                  be seen as the
                  reason we need
                  sustainable
                  development.
                  The past shapes
                  our future, so
                  what can we
                  learn from our
                  past to improve
                  our today and

                  How I see myself. How
                  I see others. How I see
                  the world. The three
                  questions that
                  configure our core
                  belief system. Art is not
                  a statement but a
                  question to your
                  viewers whether social,
                  political or personal.
                  Well, while it has no
                  “assigned” form except
                  to spark these three
                  questions, its aim
                  nonetheless to leave a
                  mark, inturn fostering a
                  change. Now I ask you,
                  how
                  better than taking time
                  and looking back IN
                  RETROSPECT?
                  Ideally, one should
                  look at a piece and
                  know where it came
                  from and when. The
                  best-case scenario
                  involves identifying the
                  artist, because well,
                  they form half the
                  contextual equation. So
                  be THAT artist, pick
                  up the brush and paint
                  your story
