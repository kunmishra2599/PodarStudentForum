                <h4>The Ensuing Tomorrow</h4>
                <p>What is happening today, that we are so doubtful about the Earth's survival? What kinds of human influences / natural phenomena are causing such dynamic changes in the earth's way of functioning? What is being done today that will ruin our tomorrow? What can be done today to make tomorrow better? Is it sustainable and ethical to exploit all the scarce resources and leave none for the future?  We will find the answers to all these questions from a humanitarian, an artist and a scientist's point of view. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                This theme takes care of the future, and how can today's actions affect the well-being of tomorrow. Ecocentric and Technocentric approaches shall be applied here in order to draw out good solutions for the problems that will be identified during the course of the theme group discussions. 
                </p>
                <h4>Change is Constant</h4>
                <p>Change is constant and history has been testament to that. Change however is a difference from our current state as a human race. But it is us who decide if the change is positive or negative. From the time of Pangea to today, from the time when there was no human race to Evolution now, from the time when man had the most simple life to today our highly technologically influenced life, the only thing that is constant is continuous change.
                So arts, sciences and humanities have had their share of  evolution and we are the today that can bring about change. Which way to take our race and life is in our hand. So what is the role of science to bring constant change to humanity to create art? 
                </p>
                <h4>In Retrospect</h4>
                <p>We learn from our mistakes and our ultimate goal is to move forward at a pace unmatchable by any other specie. But to move forward, we must take a look back, look and see what dwells in our past and reflect. Our society remains on the edge and the fate of our tomorrow solely lies in our hand, hence, it is only when we assess our past can we ride into horizons of a better future. 
                Processing what we have done and taking inspiration is what keeps fueling the fire, so look back, reflect and learn to move forward together. Reflect on not only yours, but also on the  entire mankindâ€™s decisions to ensure no further colossal damage to the society.
